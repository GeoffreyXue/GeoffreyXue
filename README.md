# Hello, I'm Geoffrey!
I'm a Computer Science/Data Science student at UW Madison. Interested in software development in general and learning about cloud technologies and databases. 

I have previous experience at ğŸ–¥ Roblox, ğŸ”’ The Master Lock Company, and ğŸ’Š Geminid Systems as a software engineering intern. My experiences shifted from front-end/mobile development to now full stack with a backend emphasis.

Outside of tech, I'm also interested in âŒ¨ speed typing and ğŸ“· photography!
